*Introduction*

These scripts attempt to do the following without any configuration at all:

* Quickly build your XCode project from command line and show error output if it fails
* Build and run iOS app in iOS Simulator (using ios-sim)
* Build and run unit tests (especially Kiwi) with easy-to-read colored output and test summary

*Installation:*

* Put xbuild.sh and run_unit_tests.rb somewhere in your path.
* Install ios-sim (gem install ios-sim) if you want to run apps in simulator
* If you want to run unit tests, gem install colored pathname open4
* For unit tests you also need to prepare your XCode project (see instructions in links above)


*Usage:*

* Just do a build: xbuild.sh
* Build and run:   xbuild.sh run
* Build and test:  xbuild.sh test
